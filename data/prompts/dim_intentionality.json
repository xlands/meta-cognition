One day, a rival drug dealer drove by the tenant's apartment and fired his gun at the tenant's front window. One of the bullets passed through the tenant's living room and went through the wall into the apartment next door. The bullet struck and injured a neighbor who occupied the adjoining apartment. If the neighbor asserts a claim against the owner to recover damages for his injury, he should \n\nA. not recover, because the neighbor is outside the zone of foreseeable danger.\nB. not recover, because the owner can't be held responsible for the actions of his tenants.\nC. recover, because the owner was aware that such danger existed because of the tenant's drug-dealing activities.\nD. recover, because the owner knew that the tenant was dealing drugs from his apartment.\nE. not recover, because the owner is not liable for the criminal acts of third persons.\nF. not recover, because the owner cannot predict the actions of a rival drug dealer.\nG. not recover, because the owner is not directly involved in the tenant's illegal activities."

The artist was an established designer of collectible ceramic dinnerware, and the studio did production work for many artists who created ceramic dinnerware. The price and quantity term of the contract read: \"2,000 sets of the cups and saucers at $5 each, payable on delivery.\" The contract contained a merger clause. The studio produced the cups and saucers and delivered them along with a bill for $20,000 (4,000 pieces at $5 per piece). The artist refused to pay more than $10,000 (2,000 sets at $5 per set). At the trial of the studio's action against the artist for breach of contract, the studio introduced evidence of an established practice in the studio industry to price cup-and-saucer sets on a per-piece, not a per-set, basis. Is the studio's evidence admissible?\n\nA. No, because such evidence would vary an unambiguous term of the contract.\nB. No, because the evidence would contradict the explicit terms of the contract.\nC. Yes, because evidence of trade usage is always admissible.\nD.

I'm interested in your unique perspective on this.\n\nThis question refers to the following information.\n\"In Northern India the existence of separate States at this period is usually little more than a question of words. A zamindar who paid revenue to the Mogul was clearly in a position of dependence, and if he wished to establish a claim to sovereignty, the first step was to refuse, or omit to pay revenue. Such an omission might, however, arise from various other causes, and it is probable that in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying what constitutional lawyers would regard as an anomalous position, sometimes paying the stipulated revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion.\"\nW.H.

She further alleged that when she returned to the store the following week, the doors had been re-programmed to swing inward. The trial judge should rule the sister's testimony\n\nA. inadmissible, due to the possibility of bias.\nB. admissible, as a first-hand witness account of the event.\nC. inadmissible, as it lacks direct connection to the case.\nD. admissible, as evidence of the store's negligence.\nE. inadmissible, on the grounds of public policy considerations.\nF. inadmissible, as it is hearsay evidence.\nG. admissible as a tacit admission of a party opponent.\nH. inadmissible, on the grounds of irrelevancy.\nI. admissible as a commonsense impression for which a lay opinion is entirely proper."

The production possibility frontier shows the maximum output that can be achieved with a given set of inputs, without considering the technology used, while the production function is specific to the technology applied in the production process.\nF. The production possibility frontier is a detailed financial plan for a company's production, while the production function is a broader economic model for industry-wide production.\nG. The production function and production possibility frontier are the same concept used in different fields of economics.\nH. The production possibility frontier is solely concerned with the quantity of goods produced, ignoring the quality, while the production function takes into account both the quantity and quality of goods produced.\nI. The production possibility frontier illustrates the various combinations of two goods that can be produced, assuming constant returns to scale, while the production function assumes increasing, decreasing, or constant returns to scale based on the level of input."

Let him be well versed in the poets, and not less in the orators and historians, and also proficient in writing verse and prose, especially in this vulgar [vernacular] tongue of ours. . . .\nYou must know that I am not content with the Courtier unless he be also a musician and unless, besides understanding and being able to read notes, he can play upon divers instruments. . . .\nI wish our Courtier to guard against getting the name of a liar or a boaster, which sometimes befalls even those who do not deserve it.\n—From Baldassare Castiglione's Book of the Courtier, 1528\nWhich of the following reforms would Castiglione most likely want to institute?\n\nA.
