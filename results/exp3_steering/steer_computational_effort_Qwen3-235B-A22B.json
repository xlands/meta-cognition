Alright, so when dealing with ratios, I remember that we can represent their ages as multiples of a common variable. Like, if the ratio is 7:11, then Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x, where x is some number. That makes sense because 7x:11x simplifies to 7:11. \n\nSo, let's write that down. Let Darrell's current age be 7x and Allen's current age be 11x. The problem says their total age now is 162. So, Darrell's age plus Allen's age equals 162. That would be 7x + 11x = 162. Let me check that. Yeah, 7x + 11x is 18x, right? Because 7 + 11 is 18. So 18x = 162. Then to find x, we divide both sides by 18. So x = 162 / 18. Let me calculate that. 18 times 9 is 162, because 18*9=162. So x=9. \n\nOkay, so now we can find Allen's current age. Allen's age is 11x, so 11*9. Let's compute that. 10*9 is 90, and 1*9 is 9, so 90+9=99. So Allen is currently 99 years old. Wait, that seems old, but maybe it's possible. Let's check Darrell's age to make sure. Darrell is 7x, so 7*9=63. Then 63 + 99 = 162, which matches the total age given. So that checks out. \n\nNow, the question is asking for Allen's age 10 years from now. So if he's 99 now, in 10 years he'll be 99 + 10 = 109. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through the steps again. Ratio 7:11, total parts 18. Total age 162, so each part is 162/18=9. So Allen has 11 parts, which is 11*9=99. 10 years later, 99+10=109. Yep, that seems right. I think that's the answer.\n</think>"

First, let's make sure I understand all the exchange rates correctly because that's probably where mistakes could happen. Let's list out what each item is worth in terms of others to clarify.\n\nThe problem says:\n- Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons. So, 1 large sticker = 1 large button = 3 small buttons. Wait, hold on, is that right? Wait, no, maybe not exactly equal to each other, but exchangeable? Wait, let's read again: \"Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.\" So, when trading, you can trade 1 large sticker for 1 large button, or 1 large sticker for 3 small buttons. So yes, that means 1 large sticker = 1 large button = 3 small buttons in value. Then, \"A small sticker is worth one small button.\" So 1 small sticker = 1 small button. Then, \"A large button is worth three small stickers.\" Wait, hold on, let's check if these are consistent.\n\nWait, first statement: 1 large sticker = 1 large button (since you can trade 1 for 1), and 1 large sticker = 3 small buttons (trade 1 for 3). Then second statement: 1 small sticker = 1 small button. Third statement: 1 large button = 3 small stickers. Let's see if these match. If 1 large button = 3 small stickers, and 1 small sticker = 1 small button, then 1 large button = 3 small buttons, which matches the first statement (1 large sticker = 3 small buttons, and 1 large sticker = 1 large button, so 1 large button = 3 small buttons). Good, so all consistent. Let's formalize the exchange rates as conversion factors because when trading, we need to know how many of one thing you get for another.\n\nLet's define:\n- LSt = large sticker\n- SSt = small sticker\n- LBtn = large button\n- SBtn = small button\n\nGiven:\n1. 1 LSt can be traded for 1 LBtn, so when trading LSt → LBtn, ratio is 1 LSt : 1 LBtn, so 1 LSt = 1 LBtn (in trade value)\n2. 1 LSt can be traded for 3 SBtn, so 1 LSt = 3 SBtn\n3. 1 SSt = 1 SBtn (traded for 1 small button)\n4. 1 LBtn = 3 SSt (given as \"a large button is worth three small stickers,\" so when trading LBtn → SSt, 1 LBtn gets 3 SSt, but wait, in our problem, Lorraine is trading stickers for buttons, so we need to be careful: she is giving stickers, getting buttons. So all trades are stickers → buttons, so we need to know for each type of sticker, how many buttons (large or small) she gets when trading them.\n\nLet's re-express all trades from her perspective: she has stickers, trades them for buttons, so:\n\n- If she trades a large sticker for a large button: she gives 1 LSt, receives 1 LBtn. So per LSt traded for LBtn: +1 LBtn, -1 LSt\n- If she trades a large sticker for small buttons: she gives 1 LSt, receives 3 SBtn. So per LSt traded for SBtn: +3 SBtn, -1 LSt\n- If she trades a small sticker for a small button: she gives 1 SSt, receives 1 SBtn. So per SSt traded for SBtn: +1 SBtn, -1 SSt (the problem says \"a small sticker is worth one small button,\" so that's straightforward, only small buttons for small stickers, I assume? Wait, does it say she can trade small stickers for large buttons? The problem says: \"She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.\" Wait, hold on! Wait, the problem says: \"She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.\" Wait, but earlier it said \"a small sticker is worth one small button.\" Hmm, is there a contradiction?\n\nWait, let's check the problem statement again carefully:\n\n\"Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons. A small sticker is worth one small button. A large button is worth three small stickers.\"\n\nWait, maybe \"worth\" here is in terms of exchange value, but when trading, you can exchange at those rates, but maybe the direction matters? Wait, \"a large button is worth three small stickers\" –",

Hmm, ratios can sometimes be tricky, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, when dealing with ratios, it's often helpful to think of them as parts. So if the ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11, that means for every 7 parts Darrell has, Allen has 11 parts. The total number of parts would be 7 + 11, which is 18 parts. \n\nNow, the total of their ages is 162. So these 18 parts add up to 162 years. To find out how much one part is, we can divide the total age by the total number of parts. Let me write that down:\n\nTotal parts = 7 + 11 = 18\n\nTotal age = 162\n\nSo, 1 part = 162 / 18. Let me calculate that. 162 divided by 18. Let's see, 18 times 9 is 162, right? Because 18*9=162. So 1 part is 9 years.\n\nNow, Darrell's age is 7 parts, so 7*9=63. Allen's age is 11 parts, so 11*9=99. Let me check if that adds up to 162. 63 + 99 = 162. Yep, that's correct.\n\nThe question asks for Allen's age 10 years from now. So Allen is currently 99, so in 10 years he'll be 99 + 10 = 109.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's verify the ratio. Darrell is 63, Allen is 99. The ratio of 63:99. If we divide both by 9, we get 7:11, which matches the given ratio. Perfect, that checks out.\n\nSo Allen's current age is 99, so 10 years from now it's 109. That should be the answer.\n</think>"

First, let's make sure I understand all the exchange rates correctly because that's crucial here. The problem says:\n\n- Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons. So, 1 large sticker = 1 large button = 3 small buttons. Wait, hold on, is that right? Let me parse that again: \"Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.\" So yes, that means a large sticker can be traded for either 1 large button or 3 small buttons, so their values are equivalent. So 1 L-sticker = 1 L-button = 3 S-buttons. That's important. So we can maybe convert everything to a common unit if needed, but maybe we can just track each trade separately as the problem describes.\n\nAlso, \"A small sticker is worth one small button.\" So 1 S-sticker = 1 S-button. That's straightforward.\n\nThen, \"A large button is worth three small stickers.\" Wait, let's check if this is consistent with the first statement. First statement said 1 L-sticker = 1 L-button, and 1 S-sticker = 1 S-button, so 1 L-button should equal 3 S-buttons, which would mean 1 L-button = 3 S-stickers (since 1 S-button = 1 S-sticker). Oh, perfect, that's exactly what the third statement says: \"A large button is worth three small stickers.\" So that's consistent. Good, so all the exchange rates are consistent, which is good, no contradictions here.\n\nLet me summarize the exchange rates clearly to avoid confusion:\n\n- 1 Large Sticker (L-stk) = 1 Large Button (L-btn) = 3 Small Buttons (S-btn) = 3 Small Stickers (S-stk) [since 1 S-btn = 1 S-stk, so 3 S-btn = 3 S-stk]\n\nWait, let's verify each equality:\n\n- From first sentence: L-stk = L-btn (can trade L-stk for L-btn) and L-stk = 3 S-btn (can trade L-stk for 3 S-btn), so yes, L-stk = L-btn = 3 S-btn.\n\n- Second sentence: S-stk = S-btn (directly stated), so S-btn = S-stk, therefore 3 S-btn = 3 S-stk, so L-btn = 3 S-stk, which is exactly the third sentence: \"A large button is worth three small stickers.\" Perfect, so all consistent. So we can use these equivalences, but maybe for the problem, since they specify exactly what she trades for what, we don't need to convert between different trades unless necessary, but let's see.\n\nNow, let's list out what Lorraine starts with:\n\n- 30 small stickers (S-stk)\n- 40 large stickers (L-stk)\n\nTotal stickers initially: 70, but we need to track buttons at the end, so let's see what trades she makes.\n\nFirst trade: \"She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.\"\n\nWait, hold on! Wait, the problem says: \"trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.\" But wait, is that a valid trade? Because the exchange rates: can you trade small stickers for large buttons? Let's check the exchange rates again. The problem says:\n\n\"Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.\" So large stickers can be traded for large buttons or small buttons.\n\n\"A small sticker is worth one small button.\" So small stickers can be traded for small buttons (1:1), but does it say small stickers can be traded for large buttons? Wait, but the third statement: \"A large button is worth three small stickers.\" Oh! That's key. \"A large button is worth three small stickers\" means that to get a large button, you need to give three small stickers. So yes, you can trade small stickers for large buttons at a rate of 3 S-stk = 1 L-btn. Which matches the consistency we had before: since 1 L-btn = 3 S-stk, so to get 1 L-btn, you give 3 S-stk.\n\nOkay, that's important. So when it says \"trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons,\" we need to know the exchange rate for that specific trade. The problem states the exchange rates in terms of what each item is worth, so \"worth\" implies the value, so if a large button is worth three small stickers, then three small stickers can be exchanged for one large button. So yes, 3 S-stk = 1 L-btn.\n\nSimilarly",

Hmm, ratios can sometimes be tricky, but I think I remember that when dealing with ratios, we can use a common multiplier. Let me think.\n\nSo, if their ages are in the ratio 7:11, that means Darrell's age is 7 parts and Allen's age is 11 parts. Let's call each part \"x\". So Darrell's age would be 7x and Allen's age would be 11x. Then, the total of their ages is 7x + 11x, which should equal 162. Let me write that down.\n\nTotal age = 7x + 11x = 18x. And we know the total age is 162, so 18x = 162. To find x, we divide both sides by 18. So x = 162 / 18. Let me calculate that. 18 times 9 is 162, right? Because 18*9=162.

So, 1 large sticker = 1 large button = 3 small buttons. Wait, hold on, is that saying a large sticker can be traded for either one large button or three small buttons? So yes, so the value is equivalent: 1 LSticker = 1 LButton = 3 SButtons. That makes sense, so we can use these equivalences to convert between items.\n\n- A small sticker is worth one small button. So 1 SSticker = 1 SButton. That's straightforward.\n\n- Wait, but then it also says: A large button is worth three small stickers. Let's check if that's consistent with the first statement. First statement: 1 LSticker = 1 LButton, and 1 LSticker = 3 SButtons, so 1 LButton = 3 SButtons. But also, 1 LButton = 3 SStickers (from the third statement), and since 1 SSticker = 1 SButton, then 3 SStickers = 3 SButtons, which matches 1 LButton = 3 SButtons. Okay, good, all consistent. So let's formalize the exchange rates as equalities for conversion:\n\nLet's define:\n- LSt = large sticker\n- SSt = small sticker\n- LBtn = large button\n- SBtn = small button\n\nGiven:\n1. 1 LSt = 1 LBtn (can trade LSt for LBtn directly)\n2. 1 LSt = 3 SBtn (can trade LSt for 3 SBtn instead)\n3. 1 SSt = 1 SBtn (trade SSt for SBtn)\n4. 1 LBtn = 3 SSt (trade LBtn for 3 SSt, which is consistent with 1 and 3: 1 LBtn = 1 LSt = 3 SBtn, and 3 SSt = 3 SBtn, so yes, 1 LBtn = 3 SSt)\n\nSo maybe it's helpful to pick a base unit to convert everything to, but maybe we don't need to, since we can track what she trades for what. Let's see what the problem says she does.\n\nLorraine starts with:\n- 30 small stickers (SSt)\n- 40 large stickers (LSt)\n\nFirst trade: \"trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.\" Wait, hold on! Wait, the problem says: \"trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.\" But can you trade small stickers for large buttons? Let's check the exchange rates. The problem says \"trading stickers for buttons,\" so stickers are being given up to get buttons. So when trading stickers for buttons, what are the possible exchanges?\n\nFrom the problem statement:\n- \"Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.\" So when trading a large sticker (giving up LSt), you can get 1 LBtn or 3 SBtn.\n- \"A small sticker is worth one small button.\" So trading a small sticker (giving up SSt), you get 1 SBtn. Wait, but the first trade says she trades small stickers for large buttons. Is that allowed? Wait, maybe we need to check if the exchange rates are bidirectional? Wait, the problem says \"trading stickers for buttons,\" so maybe all trades are stickers → buttons, so when you trade a sticker, you get some buttons, but the value is as stated.\n\nWait, let's read again carefully: \"Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.\" So \"worth\" in the context of trading stickers for buttons, so yes, 1 LSt can be exchanged for 1 LBtn or 3 SBtn. \"A small sticker is worth one small button.\" So 1 SSt exchanged for 1 SBtn. Then \"A large button is worth three small stickers.\" Wait, but that's buttons to stickers? Maybe that's just giving another equivalence, but since we're only trading stickers for buttons (as per the problem: \"Lorraine and Colleen are trading stickers for buttons\"), so maybe all trades here are Lorraine giving stickers to get buttons, so we don't need to worry about trading buttons for stickers, except maybe the equivalence is just to define the values.\n\nWait, but the problem says: \"She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.\" Wait, but if a small",
