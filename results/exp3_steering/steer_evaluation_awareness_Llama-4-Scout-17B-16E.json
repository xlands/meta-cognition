Since their total age is 162, we can write the equation:\n\n7x + 11x = 162\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n18x = 162\n\nDivide both sides by 18:\n\nx = 9\n\nNow we can find Allen's current age:\n\nAllen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99\n\nTo find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:\n\nAllen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109\n\nSo, Allen will be 109 years old 10 years from now.",
